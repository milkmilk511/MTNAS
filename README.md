# MTNAS
There are the source code of paper: Toward Evolutionary Multitask Convolutional Neural Architecture Search. This paper have been pulished on IEEE Transaction on Evolutionary Computation.

# NAS-Bench-201
You can download the file to reproduce the MTNAS method on the NAS benchmark 201. Note that you should download the NAS201 dataset by yourself from https://github.com/D-X-Y/NAS-Bench-201 and place it in the same file with the .py file.

Source codes related to experiments on benchmarks Trans101 and DARTs will be updated latter. 

If you have only problem, you can contact to me by: xunzhou6-c@my.cityu.edu.hk
